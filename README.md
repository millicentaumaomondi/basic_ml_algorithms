# Basics of Machine Learning

In this prject, we wanted to illustrate the application of machine learning on both regression and classification problems.
Therefore, we looked at the basic machine learning models like linear  and logistic regression.


- The aim of the project was to build the two models from scratch using python.

- We used data structures which helped in readability and reusage of the codes.

- We began by defining the Logistic or Linear regressiion class and then slowly built up on the proceeding functions to complete the two models.
